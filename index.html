        <h3>"How is your topic related to Artificial Intelligence"</h3>
        <p>Algorithmic bias is intertwined with AI; it's about the training, data, and decisions that AI uses. AI learns from data, which can be biased and spread dangerous misinformation. In order to create responsible AI, you must take algorithmic bias into consideration.

        <h2>Arguments:</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>"What is the argument at the heart of your topic?"</h3>
        <p>That biased training data can lead to discriminatory and misled algorithms that perpetuate harmful stereotypes. To have a successful and equitable AI, you must be responsible with ethics and data development.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>2 Main Contrasting Opinions:</h3>
        <p>According to multiple articles and people arguing on the internet, the two opinions are:</p>
        <p>AI bias isn't the problem <strong>VS.</strong> AI algorithmic bias must be actively addressed </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What supports their opinions?:</h3>
        <p>The side of AI bias isn't the problem, opts for a different perspective. They believe we need to address systematic bias and all data being put out instead of making developers add tons of guidelines and sift through data.
        </p>
        <p>The side that believes AI bias must be addressed while developing AI thinks that's unrealistic. When AI is left unchecked by humans for unbiased data, it can amplify negative bias. They believe we should address the patterns in our data as it's impossible to control bias in everything. We can't solely rely on societal improvements; it's about responsibility and ensuring that these tools contribute positively to society.

        <h2>"How does it impact daily life?"</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>AI bias has an enormous influence on everyday life and on several areas of society as a whole. Biased algorithms in the hiring and employment process can enable discrimination and prevent people from having equal chances for employment. Financial systems driven by biased AI could mistakenly widen the gaps in availability of resources. Algorithmic bias within healthcare has the possibility to cause inaccurate diagnoses and unequal treatment. When biased algorithms have an impact on the legal system, the fairness of decisions may be hindered and based in stereotypes. Education, the basis of development in society, may face issues if AI fuels incorrect data. Social media sites, which often operate through AI algorithms, have the potential to spread propaganda and create harmful echo chambers. Biased algorithms also can have an impact on customers, influencing purchase recommendations and promoting stereotypes. The prevalence of biased AI highlights the value of critical thinking, when blindly assuming information is unbiased it can lead to completely unethical conclusions.

        <h2>My Personal Stance:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Recent articles containing real-world evidence of algorithmic bias reinforce my desire to continue advancing equity and diversity in computer science, which I believe could decrease AI bias. The gender-biased AI recruiting tool that Amazon abandoned has been made public, drawing attention to the major issues confronting the technology industry. It emphasizes how easily it is for companies to let things slip by that cause minorities to lose job opportunities. The effects of bias in voice-operated systems have also been documented, as proven by the difficulties experienced by people with accents. This emphasizes the value of having DIVERSE DATA ALWAYS for equal access to tech. My advocacy in the technology industry is consistent with these findings; I want to stress the importance of inclusive programming, ethical practices, and diversity in computer science.</p>
