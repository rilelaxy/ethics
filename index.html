    <h1>So, how does my topic relate to AI?</h1>
    <p>Algorithmic bias is intertwined with AI. It's about the training, data, and decisions that AI uses.</p>
    <p>AI learns from data, which can be biased and spread dangerous misinformation.</p>
    <p>In order to create responsible AI, you must take algorithmic bias into consideration.</p>
    <p>It helps provide equity in tech.</p>

  <div class="section" id="section5">
    <h1>What is the argument at the heart of my topic?</h1>
    <p>That biased training data can lead to discriminatory and misled algorithms that perpetuate harmful stereotypes.</p>
    <p>To have a successful and equitable AI, you must be responsible with ethics and data development.</p>

    <h1>The 2 Main Contrasting Opinions:</h1>
    <p>According to multiple articles and people arguing on the internet, the two opinions are:</p> 
    <p>AI bias isn't the problem VS. AI algorithmic bias must be actively addressed.</p>

    <h1> What supports the side of AI isn't the problem? </h1>
    <p>The side of AI bias isn't the problem, opts for a different perspective.</p>
    <p>They believe we need to address systematic bias and all data being put out </p>
    <p>instead of making developers add tons of guidelines and sift through data, having to go against reality.</p>
    <p>The other side that does believe AI bias must be addressed thinks that's unrealistic.</p>
    <p>An article by Vox brings up an important part of this side of the debate</p>
    <p>“should you create a search engine that deliberately shows a more balanced mix, even if it’s not a mix that reflects reality as it is today?” </p>

    <h1> What supports the side of AI algorithmic bias must be actively addressed? </h1>
    <p>When AI is left unchecked by humans for unbiased data, it can amplify negative bias.</p>
    <p>They believe we should address the patterns in our data as it's impossible to control bias in everything.</p>
    <p>We can't solely rely on societal improvements; it's about responsibility and ensuring that these tools contribute positively to society.</p>

    <h1> What supports the side of AI algorithmic bias must be actively addressed? (Continued)</h1>
    <p>As the article from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states, “so beyond “responsible use”,</p>
    <p>We also need “responsible design” in this field. The focus on use does not presuppose which ethical approaches are best suited for tackling these issues; </p>
    <p>they might well be virtue ethics (Vallor 2017) rather than consequentialist or value-based (Floridi et al. 2018).”</p>

    <h1>How does it impact daily life?</h1>
    <p>AI bias has an enormous influence on everyday life and on several areas of society as a whole. All of these algorithms are currently in use. </p>
    <p>Algorithms in the hiring and employment, speeding up the process but can enable discrimination and prevent people from having equal chances for employment. </p>
    <p>Financial systems driven by biased AI could mistakenly widen the gaps in availability of resources, or improve it.</p>
    <p>Algorithmic bias within healthcare has the possibility to cause inaccurate diagnoses and unequal treatment but better chances of healthcare. </p>
    <p>When biased algorithms have an impact on the legal system, the fairness of decisions may be hindered and based in stereotypes. </p>

  <div class="section" id="section11">
    <h1>How does it impact daily life? (Continued)</h1>
    <p>Education, the basis of development in society, may face issues if AI fuels incorrect data but could also provide learning oppurtunities. </p>
    <p>Social media sites, which often operate through AI algorithms, have the potential to spread propaganda and create harmful echo chambers but can also provide accurate content. </p>
    <h1>The prevalence of biased AI highlights the value of critical thinking when blindly assuming information is unbiased; it can lead to completely unethical conclusions.</h1>

    <h1>My Personal Stance</h1>
    <p>I believe that AI algorithmic bias must be actively addressed.</p>
    <p>Recent articles containing real-world evidence of algorithmic bias reinforce my desire to continue advancing equity and diversity in computer science, which I believe could decrease AI bias.</p>
    <p>The gender-biased AI recruiting tool that Amazon abandoned has been made public, drawing attention to the major issues confronting the technology industry. </p>
    <p>As a woman going into a male-dominated field, it is a concern for me how easy it is for people to overlook gender-bias in AI and technology.</p>
    <p>It emphasizes how easily it is for companies to let things slip by that cause minorities to lose job opportunities. </p>

    <h1>My Personal Stance (Continued) </h1>
    <p>The effects of bias in voice-operated systems have also been documented, as proven by the difficulties experienced by people with accents.</p>
    <p>These events showcase the need of having diverse and equitable data. My advocacy in the technology industry is consistent with these findings;</p>
    <p>I want to stress the importance of inclusive programming, ethical practices, and diversity in computer science.</p>
    <h1>In order to do that, we must responsibly address AI bias.</h1>
